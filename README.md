**From Enterprise Architect → Chief AI Architect**  
A complete, reusable, Kubernetes-native reference platform for building secure, observable, governed, and cost-optimized Enterprise AI systems at scale.

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

This is **my living Chief AI Architect portfolio and reference architecture**.  
It contains everything I have designed, documented, and (soon) implemented to run production AI workloads for enterprises:

- 10-Layer AI Reference Architecture  
- Full end-to-end MLOps pipeline (training cluster + inference cluster)  
- Advanced RAG, Agentic systems, Memory layers, Guardrails  
- Zero Trust security, Responsible AI, EU AI Act compliance  
- FinOps + GreenOps + Control Plane / Data Plane separation  

Target audience:  
- Chief AI Architects  
- Principal AI Architects  
- AI Platform Engineering teams  
- Enterprise Architects moving into AI

## 📊 Architecture at a Glance

### 10-Layer Enterprise AI Reference Architecture
(Full blueprint in `01-reference-architecture/10 layer AI reference architecture - VKN.pdf`)

**Core Layers**:
1. Data Ingestion (Batch + Kafka Streaming)  
2. Data Labeling & Human Feedback (RLHF / RLAIF)  
3. Feature Store (Feast – offline + online)  
4. Model Training & Experimentation (Kubeflow + Ray + MLflow)  
5. Model Optimization (LoRA, Quantization, Pruning, KV Cache)  
6. Serving & Inference (KServe + Triton Inference Server)  
7. RAG + Agentic Layer (LangGraph, Graph RAG, Self-RAG)  
8. AI Memory Layer (Short-term, Long-term, Episodic)  
9. Monitoring, Observability & Drift Detection  
10. Governance, Security & FinOps (Zero Trust + AI-BOM + EU AI Act)

### Kubernetese first Architecture for AI first enterprise

## 🚀 MLOps End-to-End Pipeline (Already Designed)

Full pipeline (Data → Features → Training → Serving → Monitoring → Auto-retrain) is documented in `02-mlops-pipeline/`.

Key capabilities built-in:
- Multi-cluster (dedicated GPU training + autoscaling inference)  
- Data + Model versioning  
- Drift detection → auto-retraining  
- Canary / A/B testing  
- Complete observability & security  

Mermaid diagram of the pipeline (copy from previous conversation) is in `05-diagrams/mlops-pipeline.mmd`.
